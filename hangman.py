# if guess is wrong, wrongGuessCount -= 1, display to user

# display function should loop through each letter in the list, and check the object. if true (guessed correctly) display the letter, if false (not yet guessed) display '_' in its place

# display should be run after each guess is computed

# each time display is run, checkIfWonOrLost() should be run - if False not in wordObject keys, player has won. Otherwise check if wrongGuessCount = 0, in which case player has lost. Else, guess again.

# ask if they want to play again - if so, reset wrongGuessCount, alreadyGuessed, wordObject, wordList, etc.
